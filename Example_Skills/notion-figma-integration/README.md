# Notion & Figma Integration

A Claude Skill for connecting Notion project management with Figma design workflows.

## Overview

This skill bridges the gap between design and documentation by automating data transfer between Figma and Notion. Sync design components, export design tokens, and keep project pages in sync with your design files.

## Quick Start

1. Read `SKILL.md` for the full skill definition and prompt patterns.
2. Set up Notion and Figma API tokens as environment variables.
3. Describe the integration you need, specifying direction and data types.
4. Review and run the generated integration script.

## Resources

Place supporting files (API wrapper scripts, token config templates, mapping schemas) in the `resources/` folder.
