# Development Workflow

Marcus Daley's development workflow standards covering session management, build practices, testing, debugging, and portfolio priorities.

## Quick Start

Every development session follows this structure:

1. **Start**: Context recall, goal setting, scope definition, pull + clean build
2. **During**: Brainstorm-first methodology, explain decisions, build frequently, micro-chunks
3. **End**: Summarize progress, log issues, commit working state

Every feature request follows brainstorm-first:

1. Research built-in solutions
2. Generate multiple approaches (BUILT-IN, ADAPT, HYBRID, CUSTOM)
3. Discuss trade-offs
4. Design architecture
5. Implement with complete code

## What's Covered

- Brainstorm-first methodology for feature requests
- Session workflow (start, during, end)
- Build and tooling rules (UE5, web, Python)
- Testing philosophy (behavior-driven, AAA pattern)
- Version control conventions
- Structured logging and debugging workflow
- Problem Tracker and Lessons Learned templates
- Web-specific standards (frontend, backend, API design)
- Portfolio priorities and success metrics
